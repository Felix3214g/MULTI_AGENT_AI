Designing a novel cryptographic algorithm resistant to both classical and quantum computing attacks requires leveraging post-quantum cryptographic principles. A promising approach is using **lattice-based cryptography**, which is resistant to Shorâ€™s algorithm (used for breaking RSA and ECC with a quantum computer). Below is a structured approach for a new scheme:

---

## **Mathematical Foundations**
We base the scheme on **Learning With Errors (LWE)** and **NTRU lattice problems**, which are considered hard even for quantum computers.

### **Hard Problem Assumption**
Let:
- \(\mathbb{Z}_q\) be the ring of integers modulo \(q\), where \(q\) is a prime.
- \(\mathbf{A} \in \mathbb{Z}_q^{n \times n}\) be a randomly generated matrix.
- \(\mathbf{s} \in \mathbb{Z}_q^{n \times 1}\) be a secret vector.
- \(\mathbf{e} \in \mathbb{Z}_q^{n \times 1}\) be an error vector with small entries.

The problem is to distinguish \(\mathbf{A}\mathbf{s} + \mathbf{e}\) from a truly random vector in \(\mathbb{Z}_q^n\). This is computationally hard for large \(n\), forming the basis of the encryption security.

---

## **Key Generation**
1. Generate a random matrix \(\mathbf{A} \in \mathbb{Z}_q^{n \times n}\).
2. Choose a small random vector \(\mathbf{s} \in \mathbb{Z}_q^n\).
3. Choose a small error vector \(\mathbf{e} \in \mathbb{Z}_q^n\).
4. Compute the public key:  
   \[
   \mathbf{b} = \mathbf{A} \mathbf{s} + \mathbf{e}
   \]
5. The private key is \(\mathbf{s}\), and the public key is \((\mathbf{A}, \mathbf{b})\).

---

## **Encryption**
To encrypt a message \(m \in \{0,1\}^n\):

1. Convert \(m\) into a binary vector \(\mathbf{m} \in \mathbb{Z}_q^n\).
2. Choose small random vectors \(\mathbf{r}, \mathbf{e}_1, \mathbf{e}_2\).
3. Compute:
   \[
   \mathbf{u} = \mathbf{A}^T \mathbf{r} + \mathbf{e}_1
   \]
   \[
   \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{b}^T \mathbf{r} + \mathbf{e}_2 + \lfloor q/2 \rfloor \mathbf{m}
   \]
4. The ciphertext is \((\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v})\).

---

## **Decryption**
Given ciphertext \((\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v})\), and private key \(\mathbf{s}\):

1. Compute:
   \[
   \mathbf{v} - \mathbf{s}^T \mathbf{u}
   \]
2. Since \(\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{b}^T \mathbf{r} + \mathbf{e}_2 + \lfloor q/2 \rfloor \mathbf{m}\), we substitute \(\mathbf{b} = \mathbf{A} \mathbf{s} + \mathbf{e}\):

   \[
   \mathbf{v} - \mathbf{s}^T \mathbf{u} = (\mathbf{A} \mathbf{s} + \mathbf{e})^T \mathbf{r} + \mathbf{e}_2 + \lfloor q/2 \rfloor \mathbf{m} - \mathbf{s}^T (\mathbf{A}^T \mathbf{r} + \mathbf{e}_1)
   \]

   Which simplifies to:

   \[
   \mathbf{e}^T \mathbf{r} + \mathbf{e}_2 - \mathbf{s}^T \mathbf{e}_1 + \lfloor q/2 \rfloor \mathbf{m}
   \]

   Since errors are small, we recover \(\mathbf{m}\) by rounding.

## **Security Guarantees**
- **Resistant to Shorâ€™s Algorithm:** The hardness of LWE and lattice-based cryptography is not affected by quantum computers.
- **Resistant to Groverâ€™s Algorithm:** The search space is exponentially large.
- **Reduction to Worst-Case Hardness:** LWE is provably as hard as worst-case lattice problems.

## **Efficiency Comparison**
| Scheme | Security Basis | Key Size | Encryption Speed | Decryption Speed |
|--------|--------------|----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| RSA | Factoring | Small | Fast | Fast |
| ECC | Discrete Log | Smaller | Fast | Fast |
| AES | Symmetric Key | Small | Very Fast | Very Fast |
| **Our Scheme (LWE-based)** | Lattice Problems | Large | Moderate | Moderate |

Trade-offs: Our scheme has larger key sizes but provides quantum resistance.

## **Example Implementation in Python**
```python
import numpy as np

# Parameters
n = 5
q = 97  # Prime modulus

# Key Generation
A = np.random.randint(0, q, (n, n))
s = np.random.randint(0, q, (n, 1))
e = np.random.randint(-1, 2, (n, 1))  # Small noise

b = (A @ s + e) % q  # Public key
private_key = s
public_key = (A, b)

# Encryption
m = np.random.randint(0, 2, (n, 1))  # Message in binary
r = np.random.randint(0, 2, (n, 1))  # Random vector
e1 = np.random.randint(-1, 2, (n, 1))
e2 = np.random.randint(-1, 2, (1, 1))

u = (A.T @ r + e1) % q
v = (b.T @ r + e2 + (q // 2) * m) % q
ciphertext = (u, v)

# Decryption
recovered_m = np.round((v - s.T @ u) / (q // 2)) % 2

print("Original Message:\n", m)
print("Decrypted Message:\n", recovered_m)
```

## **Conclusion**
- The algorithm is **quantum-safe**, leveraging lattice problems.
- **Scalable** with security parameter \(n\).
- **Trade-off**: Larger keys but strong security.
